* We are creating an astronomy and arts curriculum and resources together and for young people in the PPG favela complex of Rio de Janeiro, in collaboration with artists and people from the community.
* Our project will create a local network of cultural projects, put children and teenagers in contact with universities and research centers in the city of Rio de Janeiro and create a knowledge space where children, teenagers and adults feel welcome and have access to material and immaterial resources.
* Children, teenagers and adults living in the favela complex will be the project contributors and users.
