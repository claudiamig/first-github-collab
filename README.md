# First Github Collab Repo

I am testing how to work with GitHub using this repository.

This page is my landing document where my readers will see me create the following elements:

* Item1
* Item2
* Item3

Testing numbered bullet points:

1. first point
2. second point
2. etcetera

Let's test adding an image:
